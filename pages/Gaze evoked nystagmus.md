- Keep patient’s head stationary. Patient looks straight ahead and fixates on a centrally placed target (clinician's nose is a good reference point) Hold 2 targets 30 degrees on each side of your nose. Note: at a minimum, targets should be >33 cm (13”) from the patient’s nose. In general, use >38 cm (>15”) as a rule of thumb.
- Ask the patient to look at the center target for 10 seconds, then look to the right (their right) for 20 seconds and back to center (5 to 10 seconds) before moving their eyes to the left target and hold for 20 seconds.
- Repeat in the vertical plane•A “Normal” test is that no nystagmus is observed. An “Abnormal” finding if nystagmus is observed. Specify nystagmus that changes directions vs nystagmus that follows Alexander’s Law**. All forms of GEN are considered central in nature – specifically from the brainstem or cerebellum but most commonly from a lesion in the cerebellar flocculus.oRemember: it is important to differentiate GEN from endpoint (beyond 30 degrees) and a “leak-through” spontaneous. **“Leak through” nystagmus is peripheral, vestibular in nature and follows Alexander’s Law.
