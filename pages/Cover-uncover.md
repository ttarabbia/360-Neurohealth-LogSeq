Alias:: (AKA Single Cover) is an alignment test to identify a tropia – starts with 1 eye blocked BUT when you uncover, the patient has binocular vision•While patient is in sitting and head is stationary, ask the patient to look at a target approximately 30 cm (12”) from their face (this is near point convergence (NPC) while 6 to 10 meters is a distant target).•Cover one eye and look for any movement in the non-covered eye. •Note if the uncovered eye remains stationary or moves inward (exotropia), moves outward (esotropia), moves upward (hypotropia), or moves downward (hypertropia).•Record as “Normal” if the eye remains stationary or “Abnormal” if any of the above corrections are made.
