- Below are the traditional points that can help clue you in to a presentation of a functional move-ment disorder. Some of these you may see with traditional movement disorders, but when you put them all together they signal a functional movement disorder:• Onset is often abrupt, with patient achieving maximal disability shortly thereafter• Patients are normal in between flare-ups and have spon-taneous remissions• Movement disorder increases with attention and decreases with distraction• Slowness, when present, has a deliberate quality. Changes in tremor frequency and amplitude are prominent• Functional disability is sometimes out of proportion with physical examination• The disorder is difficult to classify and doesn’t follow tra-ditional anatomy or nosology of movement disorders• The disorder can be unresponsive to multiple medications
