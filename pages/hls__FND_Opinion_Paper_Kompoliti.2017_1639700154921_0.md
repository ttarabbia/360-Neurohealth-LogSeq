- Below are the traditional points that can help clue you in to a presentation of a functional move-ment disorder. Some of these you may see with traditional movement disorders, but when you put them all together they signal a functional movement disorder:• Onset is often abrupt, with patient achieving maximal disability shortly thereafter• Patients are normal in between flare-ups and have spon-taneous remissions• Movement disorder increases with attention and decreases with distraction• Slowness, when present, has a deliberate quality. Changes in tremor frequency and amplitude are prominent• Functional disability is sometimes out of proportion with physical examination• The disorder is difficult to classify and doesn’t follow tra-ditional anatomy or nosology of movement disorders• The disorder can be unresponsive to multiple medications

- “What we need to convey to patients is that functional movement disorders are not ‘in their head,’ but are, in fact, in their brain.” However, rather than being what Dr. Kompoliti calls “hardware” problems, functional movement disorders are more akin to problems with “software.” “When someone has a stroke, you can see where the hardware is damaged. Here you can’t see anything structurally wrong with the hardware, but the software—i.e. the way the differ-ent parts of the brain communicate with each other
