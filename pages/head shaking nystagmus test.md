- # Instructions
	- Provide instructions to the patient that you will be performing a quick head movement (avoid using the term head shaking) – ensuring them that it will be through a very small range.
	- Note: important to clear for any cervical problems
	- Hold the patient’s head firmly with both hands on both sides while facing the patient. The literature also suggests flexing the head 20-30 degrees to optimize the horizontal canals are more parallel to the floor (acting in a truer horizontal plane).
	- Passively move their head side to side 20 times (1 rep = right to left). Ask the patient to help you move their head.
	- Abruptly stop the test and observe for nystagmus. If you observe >2 beats then record the direction of the nystagmus.
	- Repeat in the vertical plane (1 rep = upward to downward).

- # Interpretation
-
- Note: vertical nystagmus is considered more central while a unidirectional persistent post-head shaking nystagmus would indicate peripheral vestibular if produced in the horizontal vs central with the vertical test.
