			- current or previous migraine with or without aura
			- ≥5 episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity
			- Each episode lasting 5 minute  to 72 hours
			- at least 50% of these episodes involve ≥1 migrainous symptom(headache, photophobia & phonophobia, or visual aura)
			- No other explanation

- # History/Symptoms
  heading:: true
	- Past history of migraines
	- Episodic- 5 minutes to 72 hours, per diagnostic criteria
		- migraine related symptoms of headache, photophobia and phonophobia may occur before or after vestibular symptoms

		- [[Spontaneous vertigo]]
		- [[Positional vertigo]]
		- [[Visually induced dizziness]]
		- [[Imbalance]]
	- Otologic symptoms- typically mild and transient
		- tinnitus, aural pressure, hearing disturbances (can have mild, bilateral high-frequency hearing loss)
		-
- # Clinical Tests
  heading:: true
	- Clinical testing may be normal between episodes
	- [[Oculomotor]]
		- saccadic intrusions in smooth pursuit, positional nystagmus, slow and inaccurate saccades may be seen
- # Diagnostic Tests
  heading:: true
	- [[VNG]]
		- may see abnormal oculomotor findings including saccadic intrusions in smooth pursuit and slowed or inaccurate saccades
		- [[positional nystagmus]] may be seen in positional testing
	- [[Audiogram]]
		- Rule out other causes of episodic vertigo symptoms including [[Meniere's disease]] which would cause low frequency hearing loss
		- Vestibular migraine can be associated with mild, bilateral high frequency
