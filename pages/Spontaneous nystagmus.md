- Keep patient’s head stationary. Patient looks straight ahead. Observe for nystagmus.
- Record as “negative” for normal or “positive” if nystagmus noted. If present, describe the characteristics:
	- [[Shape]]
	- [[Direction]]
	- [[Intensity]]
	- [[fixation]]
- [[Peripheral vestibular nystagmus]] typically horizontal, decreases with fixation, increases when patient looks in direction of the fast phase
- 360 NEURO HEALTH©2 (Reference: Dr. Bogle, 2019)•If present, make note effects of FIXATIONi.If nystagmus decreases (or ceases) with fixation. Or, this can be stated as nystagmus increases without fixation.ii.Note: using video goggles/Frenzel lenses are the most helpful, considering that testing in room light allows the patient to fixate. In more acute peripheral vestibular events or central pathology, you may be able to observe spontaneous nystagmus without technology. •Refer to chart below for more guidelines (Dr. Bogle, 2019).•Note: If congenital nystagmus is present, the nystagmus will increase w/fixation; decrease w/convergence, and there is typically a “null” point (an area the patient can look and stop the nystagmus).
