- Closed-Glottis Valsalva (CGV),  ask the patient to block pressure in their throat (glottis). Sometimes it helps to say, “put your tongue to the top of your mouth and bear down". This results in an increased pressure of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).
	- This is preferred over the open glottis or “pinched nose” Valsalva, which could increase the CSF pressure but could potentially increase middle ear pressure.
	- The specificity of the CGV test lacks evidence-based support. Of note, however, is in Dr. Hain’s practice (a world renown specialty clinic in vestibular assessment and treatment, found the following in their patient population:
		- brief torsional nystagmus during the Valsalva maneuver to be highly specific for superior canal dehiscence.
		- A strong horizontal nystagmus is suggestive of a horizontal canal fistula such as might result from a cholesteatoma or fenestration surgery.
