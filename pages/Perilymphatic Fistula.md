- # Summary
  heading:: true
	- An abnormal connection in the oval window and/or round window that separates the air filled middle ear and fluid filled perilymphatic space of the inner ear. This opening allows perilymph to leak into the middle ear. Symptoms of PLF typically include ear fullness, dizziness, fluctuations in hearing and, at times, sudden hearing loss. Symptoms usually worsen with barometric pressure changes or increased CSF pressure (e.g., heaving lifting, coughing, etc). Conservative treatment is warranted if there is no significant hearing loss and consists of pharmaceutical management similar to Meniereâ€™s Disease and vestibular therapy to address dizziness and/or balance problems. Surgery may be indicated as well as a referral to vestibulartherapy for residual symptoms post-op.
