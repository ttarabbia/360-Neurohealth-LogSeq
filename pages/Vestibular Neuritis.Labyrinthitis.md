alias:: Vestibular Neuritis, Labyrinthitis, Neuritis, neuronitis, vesitbular neuronitis

- # Summary
  heading:: true
	- Vestibular neuritis is caused by an inner ear infection that causes inflammation to the vestibular nerve
	- Labyrinthitis presents similarly to a vestibular neuritis but with hearing loss caused by inflammatory response to the inner ear as a whole or both branches of the vestibulocochlear nerve
	- Infection is typically viral and rarely bacterial
	- Inner ear infections are single events >95% of the time
- # History/Symptoms
  heading:: true
	- Sudden onset of acute vertigo, unsteadiness, nausea and often vomiting.
	- Acute onset typically lasting days
	- Following the resolution of acute vertigo symptoms, patients typically have residual symptoms of [[Head movement related dizziness]] and [[Imbalance]] following a vestibular pattern
	- Labyrinthitis- accompanied by sudden hearing loss, neuritis- no hearing loss
- # Clinical Tests
  heading:: true
- [[Spontaneous nystagmus]] seen in the acute phase
	- direction- horizontal, away from the affected ear
	- increases with fixation removed
	- Follow's [[Alexander's law]]
- [[Head thrust test]] positive to the involved side
- [[Dynamic visual acuity test]] 3 line or greater loss and symptom reproduction (if patients has uncompensated [[VOR]] dysfunction)
- [[Static balance]]
	- impaired use of vestibular inputs (unstable surface with eyes closed)
- [[Dynamic Balance]]

- # Treatments
