Alias:: eye ROM

- # Instructions
	- While patient is in sitting and head is stationary, ask the patient to look at a target (>38 cm or >15” in front of their face to avoid convergence).
	- Move the target in a box formation around their face and observe if the eyes move conjugately (together). The size of the box will push their eyes more into end range.
- # Interpretation
- This is not a test of smooth pursuit but a simple screen of eye ROM. And, keep in mind that you are in ranges of end-point, so you may see some nystagmus and this can be normal, especially in individuals >65 yo
- Also make note if the patient reports any diplopia (double vision). If diplopia is reported, make note if in horizontal or vertical plane
