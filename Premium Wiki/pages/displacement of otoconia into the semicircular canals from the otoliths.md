- Otoconia AKA “ear crystals” or “ear rocks” or “particles” –change canal response
	- otoconia are 3-30 um1 -- almost 3x heavier than endolymph, Size and amount of dislodged particles vary
	- Particles fall through the endolymph, creating a drag
	- Falling particles push endolymph down which causes cupula deflection resulting in nystagmus
