alias:: Vestibular Neuritis, Labyrinthitis, Neuritis, neuronitis, vesitbular neuronitis

- # Summary
  heading:: true
	- Vestibular neuritis is caused by an inner ear infection that causes inflammation to the vestibular nerve
	- Labyrinthitis presents similarly to a vestibular neuritis but with hearing loss caused by an inflammatory response to the inner ear as a whole or both branches of the vestibulocochlear nerve
	- Infection is typically viral and rarely bacterial
	- Inner ear infections are single events >95% of the time
- # History/Symptoms
  heading:: true
	- Sudden onset of acute vertigo, unsteadiness, nausea and often vomiting.
	- Acute onset typically lasting days
	- Following the resolution of acute vertigo symptoms, patients typically have residual symptoms of [[Head movement related dizziness]] and [[Imbalance]] following a [[vestibular pattern]]
	- Labyrinthitis- accompanied by sudden hearing loss, neuritis- no hearing loss
- # Clinical Tests
	- ### [[(Expected results included in premium offering)]]
		- [[Spontaneous nystagmus]]
		- [[Head thrust test]]
		- [[Dynamic visual acuity test]]
		- [[Static balance]]
		- [[Dynamic Balance]]

- # Diagnostic Tests
  heading:: true
	- ### [[(Expected results included in premium offering)]]
		- [[VNG]]
- # Treatments
	- In the acute phases, pharmaceutical intervention is often needed (vestibular suppressants and anti-nausea medication).
	- Steroids can be helpful especially with acute hearing loss
	- Vestibular therapy to address:
		- VOR dysfunction
		- Static balance emphasizing use of vestibular inputs
		- Dynamic balance integrating head motion
